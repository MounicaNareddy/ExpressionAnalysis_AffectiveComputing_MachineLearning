Analyzing 3D facial landmarks, as well as action units, and physiological data using WEKA by running them through 3 classic machine learning algorithms (e.g. Random Forest, SVM, and Naïve Bayes) using WEKA. Pre-processed data before inputting it into WEKA.  This program reads in an arff file and translates(origin/random), rotates(x-axis/y-axis/z-axis), scales, and creates features from the 3D landmarks in space. Then writes each feature which is translated to an arff file (along with the action units, physiological data, and class). Load this arff into WEKA and run the classifiers Random Forest, SVM, and Naïve Bayes with the classification experiments, 2-fold cross validation, 10-fold cross validation and Supplied test set. Analyzed the results. Also ranked the features and got the top 10% (25 features).
